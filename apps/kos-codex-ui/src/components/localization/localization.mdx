# Localization and translations

kOS has built-in localization support to make it easy to create multilingual applications. The sdk offers a number of tools that manage localization in a similar way to the popular react-i18next package. The translation files are loaded via kab files.

## Translation files

Translation files are generated by the `kosui i18n:namespace` command. This command will generate a namespace file for each translation namespace in your application. The namespace file is a JSON file that contains the translations for that namespace.

## LocalizationProvider

The `LocalizationProvider` is a React component that wraps your application and provides the necessary context for localization. It takes a `appContext` array as a prop, which is a list of the translation namespaces to use. It also takes a locale prop.
