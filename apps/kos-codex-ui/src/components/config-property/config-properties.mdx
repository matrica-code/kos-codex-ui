# Accessing Config Properties

A kOS powered device can rely on a lot of configuration properties. Anything from the size of a pour, or the name of the device. These are viewable via the configuration viewer within kOS Studio.

Those properties can be accessed within code with the `@kosConfigProperty` decorator.

<Snippet name="device-model-string@device-model.ts" />

The value can be consumed by your app (either in models or in the UI) and can also be updated via the `updateProperty` method.

<Snippet name="ConfigProperty@config-property.tsx" />

As you might expect, configuration state persists, relative to the more ephemeral data state we've been using for our other models.

## Config Property Types

Config properties can be of different types, as defined in the schema on the java side. This can include a range with steps, an enum, numbers, and booleans.

### Enums

Config properties that are enums provide a list of options that can be selected. This can be used for creating a `select` element that will allow the user to choose from a list of options.

On the model:
<Snippet name="device-model-enum@device-model.ts" />

<Snippet name="ConfigPropertyEnum@config-property-enum.tsx" />

### Boolean

<Snippet name="device-model-boolean@device-model.ts" />

<Snippet name="ConfigProperty@config-property-boolean.tsx" />

Config properties that are booleans are simple true/false values. This can be used for creating a `checkbox` element that will allow the user to toggle the value.
