# Accessing Config Properties

A kOS powered device can rely on a lot of configuration properties. Anything from the size of a pour, or the name of the device. These are viewable via the configuration viewer within kOS Studio.

Those properties can be accessed within code with the `@kosConfigProperty` decorator.

<Snippet name="ConfigDecorator@configuration-model.ts" />

The value can be consumed by your app (either in models or in the UI) and can also be updated via the `updateProperty` method.

<Snippet name="ConfigProperty@config-property.tsx" />

As you might expect, configuration state persists, relative to the more ephemeral data state we've been using for our other models.
