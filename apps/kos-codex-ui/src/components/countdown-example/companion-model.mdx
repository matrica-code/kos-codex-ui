# Companion Models

As part of the model framework, you may want to extend a specific model to add functionality. Instead of this, the preferred pattern within kOS is the use of companion models. A companion model favours composition over inheritance, and enables the creation of a model that is tightly coupled to another model while extending its functionality.

For this example, let's create a companion model to our Counter, called Countdown - this allows us to have a `Countdown` that doesn't have to duplicate all of the logic of the `Counter` but instead can utilize that parent's methods to provide new functionality.

When the initial model is created, a companion model is also created.

To create a companion model we use `kosui:companion` which will set up the proper typing. We also need to register the model, as well as _register it as a companion model_ within the registration chain.

`.register(ParentModel.type, CompanionModel.type)`

<Snippet name="countdown@countdown-model.ts" />

In this case we're adding a `reset` method and creating a new computed property - time remaining. The original countdown model is unchanged but we can now use some of the underlying logic and add onto the functionality.

In order to access the companion model, we use the `getCompanionModel` utility, either in the model or within a react component.
