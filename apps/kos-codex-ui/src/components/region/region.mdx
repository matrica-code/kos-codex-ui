# Region Support

Region-handling is supported within kOS as a dedicated Region Service. A region model is provided by the kOS core, and there are hooks and other tools provided by the sdk to handle the region.

Region support includes handling for datetime, as well as units of measure.

## Date handling

Support for the date and time is handled by a number of hooks, including `useKosRegions`, `useFormattedTime` and `useFormattedDate`

<Snippet name="Region@region.tsx" />

The above code renders like this:

<Canvas of={RegionStory} />

## Units of measure

Support for units of measure (SI units vs Imperial) is also handled by the region service. This includes helper functions to convert units from SI to Imperial.

<Canvas of={UnitsStory} />

## Config Properties

Units of measure are often held within configuration as specific units. The unit is stored within the configuration as a specific unit, but the region service can handle conversion both on read and write, so the end-user is always dealing with units they are more familiar with.

Like before, the config property is defined in the model with the `@kosConfigProperty` decorator.

<Snippet name="unit-example-config@unit-example-model.ts" />

In the component, we use the HOC to get the config property from the model. Even if we're using US units, the region service will convert the value to SI units both as we read and write the value.

<Snippet name={["unit-config@unit-config.tsx", "unit-config-export@unit-config.tsx"]} />

<Canvas of={UnitConfigStory} />

## Display Formatting

## Unit Overrides

In some cases and regions, there are exceptions to the unit system. In Canada, for example, you would primarily use SI units for volume, but use Imperial units for pressure. In that case, you can modify the decorator to specify the unit you want to use.
