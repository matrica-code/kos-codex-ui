# Accessing model data

## Hooks and HoCs

`kosui hook` generates hooks and higher-order components that can access models to provide the UI with data. Both have trade-offs - the hook is simple to use but the model is not guaranteed so some handling needs to take place to provide type safety.

The higher-order component provides the model, but if used too much could have a performance impacts. When a model needs to be used sparingly, both of these approaches work well.

## Context

If a specific model is used a lot within a specific section of the UI, using `context` will help to reduce the use of HoCs or prop drilling. For more information on Context as a concept, check out the (react docs)[https://react.dev/learn/passing-data-deeply-with-context].

kOS provides a generator to create model contexts, which provides the tools needed to access the model without multiple HoCs or hooks. Use `kosui context` to generate the appropriate files, then use the `provider` higher up in the tree and use the hook provided to access it further down.
